    Dr. Nelson recommends Acana because this premium brand thoughtfully crafts food with farm-fresh and protein-rich ingredients to meet the nutritional needs of cats. The dry cat food line includes seven varieties, but this particular kibble is great for picky eaters because it carefully balances calories, protein, and fat, plus includes ingredients that will help your feline maintain a healthy weight, as well as skin, coat, eye, and heart health, Dr. Nelson says. Acana does follow AAFCO guidelines, and could be a great option for pet parents who want to try a diet produced outside of the bigger manufacturers.
